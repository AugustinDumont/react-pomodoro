# react-pomodoro

Pomodoro made with React.

# Minimal requirements
Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).
Four buttons:
plus (+) and minus (-), they will allow the user to adjust the minutes counter - only when it's stopped.
start, to run the timer (it will then change to stop), to serve as a toggle button
reset, toâ€¦ reset the timer to its original value
At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to take a break. The modal will have two buttons:
One to close the modal
Another to close the modal and start a new timer

# Dificulties 
I did this pomodoro following the tutorial : 

https://medium.com/@marjuhirsh/a-beginners-account-of-building-a-pomodoro-clock-in-react-2d03f856b28a

The tutorial is not completed. I found out many errors to solve. I finally finished the pomodoro on my own, what has been a really good way of learning. I know my way to achieve this pomodoro is not the best, that's why I gonna do another one/  

As first project to discover React, I had many and many scoop problems but could resolve them. 

My goal is to learn more about hooks, others React particularities and go on practicing with React.
